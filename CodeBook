Title:  Predicting Human Activity Using Samsung Dataset
Introduction:
Smartphones are equipped with various sensor technologies, two of which are the accelerometer and gyroscope.  “The accelerometer detects the 3-dimensional (3D) spatial orientation of the device and measures its acceleration relative to freefall in three different axes: X, Y, and Z. A gyroscope measures or maintains orientation, based on the principles of angular momentum. Combining a gyroscope with an accelerometer allows the [smartphones] to sense motion on six axes – left, right, up, down, forward and backward, as well as roll, pitch and yaw rotations – allowing for more accurate motion-sensing abilities [1].  

Data Source:

The data used in this data cleaning exercise is a subset of the “Human Activity Recognitions Using Smartphones Dataset” collected by Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory, 
University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy. The data were from 30 participants with ages ranging from 19 to 48 years old. Six human activities, namely: walking, walking upstairs or downstairs, sitting, standing and laying down were recorded by Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones worn on the waist by each participants.. A detailed description of the experiment and the data set is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository [2].  This dataset was downloaded from the course website:
